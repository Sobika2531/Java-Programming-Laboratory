1. Define a class called Time that has data fields: seconds, minutes and hour of type integer. Time should have setSecond(), setMinute(), setHr() and constructors (default), 
toString() that will print the details of Time instance.
Modify this Time class such that IllegalArgumentException is thrown if the set methods gets arguments less than zero and greater than 59.
When initialising second, minute, hour using set methods ensure that the argument passed is not less than zero and not greater than 59, throw IllegalArgumentException in the 
method.
  Note : IllegalArgumentException is thrown in order to indicate that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument

2. Create a class called Invoice that a Grocery store might use to represent an invoice for an item sold at the store. An Invoice should include four pieces of information as 
instance variables—a part number (type integer), a part description (type String), quantity of the item being purchased (type integer) and a price per item (double). Provide 
methods constructor with four arguments.
Write a test application to create an instance and validate the input obtained using Scanner object. Ensure that part number is value greater than 0, part description is not 
null string, quantity of the item and price per item is value greater than 0.
  Note : The InputMismatchException is thrown when attempting to retrieve a value using the Scanner class that doesn’t match the expected pattern or type.
  
3. Create an array of Invoice and throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when it accesses the array of Invoice to print the details using toString method in Invoice class.

4. Modify the question 2 (Invoice) to throw the custom exception that throws an exception with message “partnumber not found” if the partnumber is null.

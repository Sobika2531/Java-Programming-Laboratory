1. Write a simple generic version of method isEqualTo that compares its two arguments with the equals method and returns true if they’re equal and false otherwise. 
Use this generic method in a program that calls is EqualTo with a variety of built-in types, such as Object or Integer.

2. Write a generic class Pair which has two type parameters- F and S each representing the type of the first and second element of the pair, respectively. 
Add get and set methods for the first and second elements of the pair. Test the generic class Pair with different types – integer, String, built-in types

3. Your application chooses the number to be guessed by selecting an integer at random in the range 1–1000. The application then displays the following in a label:
  I have a number between 1 and 1000. Can you guess my number?
  Please enter your first guess.

    A JTextField should be used to input the guess. As each guess is input, the background color should change to either red or blue. Red indicates that the user is getting 
“warmer,” and blue, “colder.” A JLabel should display either "Too High" or "Too Low" to help the user zero in. When the user gets the correct answer, "Correct!" should be 
displayed, and the JTextField used for input should be changed to be uneditable. A JButton should be provided to allow the user to play the game again. When the JButton is 
clicked, a new random number should be generated and the input JTextField changed to be editable.

4. Create the following GUI (see image4). You do not have to provide any functionality.
